1️⃣ **SOQL inside `for` loops** → Avoid SOQL queries inside loops to prevent governor limit errors.
2️⃣ **Unsecured SOQL queries** → Ensure queries have proper filtering to avoid security risks.
3️⃣ **Unbulkified DML operations** → Optimize DML statements for large datasets to prevent governor limit errors.
4️⃣ **Hardcoded IDs** → Avoid hardcoding IDs; fetch them dynamically instead.
5️⃣ **Improper use of `@AuraEnabled`** → Ensure methods are secured and properly scoped.
6️⃣ **Excessive CPU time usage** → Avoid deep nesting and unnecessary computations to reduce CPU time.
